# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## What is SDLC?

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used by software development teams to design, develop, test, and deploy high-quality software. It provides a systematic approach to software development with defined phases, activities, and deliverables.

## SDLC Models

### 1. Waterfall Model

**Description**: Sequential development model where each phase must be completed before the next begins.

**Characteristics**:
- Linear and sequential approach
- Each phase has specific deliverables
- No overlap between phases
- Changes are difficult to implement

**Advantages**:
- Simple and easy to understand
- Well-documented process
- Clear milestones and deliverables
- Good for projects with stable requirements

**Disadvantages**:
- Inflexible to changes
- Late detection of issues
- No working software until late in the cycle
- High risk for complex projects

**When to Use**:
- Small projects with clear requirements
- Technology is well understood
- Requirements are stable

### 2. V-Model (Verification and Validation)

**Description**: Extension of waterfall model that emphasizes testing at each development phase.

**Characteristics**:
- Each development phase has a corresponding test phase
- Testing activities start early in the development process
- Strong emphasis on verification and validation

**Phases and Corresponding Tests**:
- Requirements → Acceptance Testing
- System Design → System Testing
- Detailed Design → Integration Testing
- Coding → Unit Testing

**Advantages**:
- Early test planning
- Defects found early
- Clear testing strategy
- Good for projects with stable requirements

**Disadvantages**:
- Inflexible like waterfall
- No early prototypes
- High risk for complex projects

### 3. Iterative Model

**Description**: Software is developed in iterations, with each iteration adding new functionality.

**Characteristics**:
- Repeated cycles of development
- Each iteration includes all SDLC phases
- Working software produced in each iteration
- Feedback incorporated in subsequent iterations

**Advantages**:
- Working software available early
- Flexible to changes
- Risk reduction through early feedback
- Better stakeholder involvement

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires good planning
- More resources needed for management
- Not suitable for small projects

### 4. Incremental Model

**Description**: Software is built in increments, with each increment adding new features.

**Characteristics**:
- System functionality divided into increments
- Each increment is a complete mini-project
- Core functionality delivered first
- Additional features added in subsequent increments

**Advantages**:
- Early delivery of core functionality
- Lower initial cost
- Easier to test and debug
- Customer satisfaction through early delivery

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires good planning and design
- Integration complexity
- May require more resources

### 5. Spiral Model

**Description**: Risk-driven model that combines iterative development with systematic risk analysis.

**Characteristics**:
- Four main activities in each spiral:
  1. Planning
  2. Risk Analysis
  3. Engineering
  4. Evaluation
- Emphasis on risk assessment
- Prototype development

**Advantages**:
- Strong risk management
- Suitable for large, complex projects
- Flexible and adaptive
- Early prototyping

**Disadvantages**:
- Complex to manage
- Expensive due to risk analysis
- Requires risk assessment expertise
- May lead to over-engineering

### 6. Agile Model

**Description**: Iterative and incremental development with emphasis on collaboration and working software.

**Characteristics**:
- Short development cycles (sprints)
- Continuous customer collaboration
- Adaptive planning
- Working software over comprehensive documentation

**Advantages**:
- Quick response to changes
- Customer satisfaction through continuous delivery
- Improved team productivity
- Better quality through continuous testing

**Disadvantages**:
- Less emphasis on documentation
- Requires experienced team members
- Customer involvement throughout the project
- Difficult to estimate costs and time
