# Agile Methodologies

## Introduction

Agile methodologies are iterative and incremental approaches to software development that emphasize collaboration, flexibility, and customer satisfaction. Agile emerged as a response to the limitations of traditional waterfall development methods.

## History and Evolution

### Pre-Agile Era (1970s-1990s)
- Heavyweight, documentation-driven processes
- Waterfall and V-model dominance
- Long development cycles
- Limited customer involvement

### Agile Manifesto (2001)
Seventeen software developers met in Utah and created the Agile Manifesto, which states:

**"We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:"**

### The Four Values

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

*"That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more."*

### The Twelve Principles

1. **Customer satisfaction** through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
2. **Welcome changing requirements**, even late in development
3. **Deliver working software frequently**, from weeks to months, with preference for shorter timescales
4. **Business people and developers** must work together daily throughout the project
5. **Build projects around motivated individuals**, give them the environment and support they need
6. **Face-to-face conversation** is the most efficient method of conveying information
7. **Working software** is the primary measure of progress
8. **Sustainable development** - maintain a constant pace indefinitely
9. **Continuous attention** to technical excellence and good design enhances agility
10. **Simplicity** - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done
11. **Self-organizing teams** produce the best architectures, requirements, and designs
12. **Regular reflection** and adjustment of behavior to become more effective

## Core Agile Concepts

### Iterative and Incremental Development

**Iterative**: Repeating cycles of development activities
**Incremental**: Adding new functionality in each cycle

**Benefits**:
- Early feedback and course correction
- Reduced risk through smaller increments
- Continuous improvement
- Better adaptability to change

### Time-Boxing

**Definition**: Fixed time periods for development activities

**Common Time-boxes**:
- **Sprints**: 1-4 weeks (typically 2 weeks)
- **Releases**: Multiple sprints (2-6 months)
- **Daily standups**: 15 minutes

### User Stories

**Format**: "As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"

**Example**:
```
As a customer,
I want to track my order status online
So that I know when to expect delivery

Acceptance Criteria:
- Customer can enter order number
- System displays current status
- System shows estimated delivery date
- System handles invalid order numbers gracefully
```

**INVEST Criteria for Good User Stories**:
- **Independent**: Can be developed independently
- **Negotiable**: Details can be discussed
- **Valuable**: Provides value to users
- **Estimable**: Can be estimated for effort
- **Small**: Can be completed in one iteration
- **Testable**: Has clear acceptance criteria

### Continuous Integration and Delivery

**Continuous Integration (CI)**:
- Frequent code integration (multiple times per day)
- Automated builds and tests
- Quick feedback on code changes

**Continuous Delivery (CD)**:
- Software always in releasable state
- Automated deployment pipeline
- Quick and reliable releases

## Popular Agile Frameworks

### 1. Scrum

**Overview**: Framework for managing product development using iterative and incremental practices.

#### Scrum Roles

**Product Owner**:
- Defines product vision and roadmap
- Manages product backlog
- Prioritizes features based on business value
- Makes decisions about what to build

**Scrum Master**:
- Facilitates Scrum process

- Self-organizing and self-managing
- Responsible for delivering working software
- Collectively owns the work

#### Scrum Artifacts

**Product Backlog**:
- Prioritized list of features/requirements
- Maintained by Product Owner
- Continuously refined and updated
- Items described as user stories

**Sprint Backlog**:
- Subset of product backlog for current sprint
- Includes tasks needed to complete user stories
- Owned by development team
- Updated daily

**Increment**:
- Sum of all product backlog items completed during sprint
- Must be in "Done" state
- Potentially shippable product increment

#### Scrum Events

**Sprint Planning** (4-8 hours for 2-4 week sprint):
- Team selects items from product backlog
- Creates sprint goal
- Plans how to achieve the goal
- Creates sprint backlog

**Daily Scrum** (15 minutes):
- Daily synchronization meeting
- Team members share:
  - What they did yesterday
  - What they plan to do today
  - Any impediments they face

**Sprint Review** (2-4 hours):
- Demonstrate completed work to stakeholders
- Get feedback on the increment
- Discuss what was accomplished
- Review and adjust product backlog

**Sprint Retrospective** (1.5-3 hours):
- Team reflects on the sprint process
- Identifies what went well
- Identifies areas for improvement
- Creates action items for next sprint

#### Scrum Process Flow

```
Product Backlog → Sprint Planning → Sprint Backlog → Sprint (1-4 weeks)
                                        ↓
                Daily Scrum ← Development Work → Sprint Review

## Agile Estimation and Planning

### Estimation Techniques

#### 1. Planning Poker

**Process**:
1. Present user story to team
2. Team discusses story briefly
3. Each member selects estimate card secretly
4. All cards revealed simultaneously
5. Discuss differences and re-estimate if needed

**Card Values**: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100, ∞, ?

#### 2. T-Shirt Sizing

**Sizes**: XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL
- Quick and intuitive
- Good for high-level estimation
- Less precise than story points

#### 3. Story Points

**Characteristics**:
- Relative estimation unit
- Based on complexity, effort, and uncertainty
- Team-specific (velocity varies by team)
- Fibonacci-like sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21

#### 4. Affinity Estimation

**Process**:
1. Write stories on cards
2. Arrange cards by relative size
3. Assign numbers to groups
4. Useful for large numbers of stories

### Velocity and Capacity

**Velocity**: Amount of work team completes in a sprint (story points or stories)
**Capacity**: Maximum work team can handle (hours or story points)

**Velocity Calculation**:
```
Sprint 1: 20 story points
Sprint 2: 25 story points  
Sprint 3: 18 story points
Average Velocity: (20 + 25 + 18) / 3 = 21 story points
```

### Release Planning

**Steps**:
1. Define release goal and timeline
2. Estimate product backlog items
3. Calculate team velocity
4. Determine scope based on velocity and timeline
5. Create release plan with sprint breakdown

## Agile Requirements Management

### User Story Mapping

**Process**:
1. Identify user activities (backbone)
2. Break activities into tasks
3. Prioritize tasks by importance
4. Group tasks into releases/sprints

**Benefits**:
- Shared understanding of user journey
- Visual representation of features
- Priority-based release planning

### Acceptance Criteria

**Formats**:

**Given-When-Then (Gherkin)**:
```
Given I am a registered user
When I enter valid login credentials
Then I should be logged into the system
And I should see the dashboard
```

**Checklist Format**:
- User can enter email and password
- System validates credentials
- User is redirected to dashboard
- Invalid credentials show error message

### Definition of Ready (DoR)

Criteria for user stories to enter a sprint:
- Story is independent
- Acceptance criteria are defined
- Story is estimated
- Dependencies are identified
- Story is small enough for one sprint

### Definition of Done (DoD)

2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass test
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

**Benefits**:
- Better code design
- High test coverage
- Confidence in changes
- Documentation through tests

**Example**:
```java
// 1. Red - Write failing test
@Test
public void shouldCalculateTotalPrice() {
    Calculator calc = new Calculator();
    assertEquals(15.0, calc.calculateTotal(10.0, 0.5), 0.01);
}

// 2. Green - Minimal implementation
public class Calculator {
    public double calculateTotal(double price, double taxRate) {
        return price + (price * taxRate);
    }
}

// 3. Refactor - Improve if needed
```

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

**Focus**: Behavior and collaboration between stakeholders

**Gherkin Syntax**:
```gherkin
Feature: User Login
  As a user
  I want to log into the system
  So that I can access my account

Scenario: Successful login
  Given I am on the login page
  When I enter valid credentials
  Then I should be logged in
  And I should see the dashboard
```
