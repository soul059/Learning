## Overview

Software Engineering is a systematic approach to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of software systems. It combines engineering principles with software development to create reliable, efficient, and maintainable software solutions.

## Key Principles

- **Modularity**: Breaking down complex systems into smaller, manageable components
- **Abstraction**: Hiding implementation details while exposing essential features
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data
- **Separation of Concerns**: Dividing a program into distinct sections
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoiding code duplication
- **SOLID Principles**: Five design principles for maintainable software

## Learning Path

1. Start with the fundamentals (Introduction, SDLC)
2. Learn requirements and design principles
3. Study testing methodologies
4. Explore agile practices and project management
5. Understand advanced topics like DevOps and metrics
