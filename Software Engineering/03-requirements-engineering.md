# Requirements Engineering

## Introduction

Requirements Engineering (RE) is the systematic process of discovering, analyzing, documenting, and maintaining software requirements. It's a critical phase that determines the success or failure of a software project, as poor requirements are one of the leading causes of project failures.

## What are Requirements?

Requirements are statements that describe what a system should do, how it should behave, or what properties it should have. They serve as a contract between stakeholders and the development team.

### Types of Requirements

#### 1. Functional Requirements
**Definition**: Specify what the system should do - the functions and services it should provide.

**Characteristics**:
- Describe system behavior
- Define inputs, outputs, and processing
- Specify system responses to particular inputs

**Examples**:
- "The system shall allow users to log in using email and password"
- "The system shall generate monthly sales reports"
- "The system shall send email notifications for overdue tasks"

#### 2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
**Definition**: Specify how the system should perform - quality attributes and constraints.

**Categories**:

**Performance Requirements**:
- Response time: "The system shall respond to user queries within 2 seconds"
- Throughput: "The system shall handle 1000 concurrent users"
- Resource usage: "The application shall use no more than 512MB of RAM"

**Security Requirements**:
- Authentication: "Users must authenticate using multi-factor authentication"
- Authorization: "Only administrators can access user management features"
- Data protection: "All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit"

**Usability Requirements**:
- Ease of use: "New users should be able to complete basic tasks within 5 minutes"
- Accessibility: "The system shall comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards"
- User interface: "The system shall provide a responsive web interface"

**Reliability Requirements**:
- Availability: "The system shall be available 99.9% of the time"
- Fault tolerance: "The system shall continue operating if one server fails"
- Recovery time: "System shall recover from failures within 30 seconds"

**Scalability Requirements**:
- User growth: "System shall support growth to 100,000 users"
- Data growth: "System shall handle up to 1TB of data"
- Geographic distribution: "System shall support users across multiple time zones"

**Compliance Requirements**:
- Regulatory: "System shall comply with GDPR regulations"
- Standards: "System shall follow ISO 27001 security standards"
- Industry-specific: "System shall comply with HIPAA for healthcare data"

#### 3. Domain Requirements
**Definition**: Requirements that arise from the application domain and reflect characteristics of that domain.

**Examples**:
- Medical systems: "The system shall maintain patient confidentiality"
- Financial systems: "All transactions must be logged for audit purposes"
- Aviation systems: "The system shall meet DO-178C safety standards"

## Requirements Engineering Process

### 1. Requirements Elicitation

**Objective**: Discover and gather requirements from stakeholders.

**Techniques**:

### 4. Requirements Validation

**Objective**: Ensure requirements are correct, complete, and feasible.

**Validation Techniques**:

**Reviews and Inspections**:

- Validate against domain knowledge
- Use formal verification techniques

### 5. Requirements Management

**Objective**: Handle changes to requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

**Activities**:

**Change Control**:
- Change request process
- Impact analysis
- Approval workflows

**Version Control**:
- Track requirement versions
- Maintain change history
- Baseline management

**Traceability Management**:
- Forward traceability (requirements to design/code/tests)
- Backward traceability (code/tests to requirements)
- Bidirectional traceability

**Status Tracking**:
- Track implementation status
- Monitor testing progress
- Report on requirement coverage

## Requirements Documentation

### Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Structure

**1. Introduction**
- Purpose and scope
- Definitions and abbreviations
- References

**2. Overall Description**
- Product perspective
- Product functions
- User characteristics
- Constraints

**3. Specific Requirements**
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Interface requirements

**4. Appendices**

- Issues list

### User Story Format

```
As a [type of user]
I want [some goal]
So that [some reason/value]

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given [context]
- When [action]
- Then [outcome]
```

**Example**:
```
As a customer
I want to track my order status
So that I know when to expect delivery

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given I have placed an order
- When I enter my order number
- Then I see the current status and estimated delivery date
```

### Use Case Template

**Use Case Name**: Login to System

**Actor**: User

**Preconditions**: User has valid credentials

**Main Flow**:
1. User enters username and password
2. System validates credentials
3. System displays main dashboard
4. Use case ends

**Alternative Flows**:
