# Software Design and Architecture

## Introduction

Software Design and Architecture is the process of defining the structure, components, interfaces, and other characteristics of a software system. It bridges the gap between requirements and implementation, providing a blueprint for building the system.

## Software Design vs. Software Architecture

### Software Architecture
**Definition**: High-level structure of a software system, defining major components and their relationships.

**Characteristics**:
- System-wide decisions
- Difficult to change later
- Affects non-functional requirements
- Involves architectural patterns and styles

**Example**: Deciding to use a microservices architecture with REST APIs

### Software Design
**Definition**: Detailed design of individual components and their internal structure.

**Characteristics**:
- Component-level decisions
- More flexible and changeable
- Focuses on implementation details
- Involves design patterns

**Example**: Designing a specific class hierarchy for user management

## Design Principles

### 1. SOLID Principles

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**Definition**: A class should have only one reason to change.

**Example**:
```java
// Violates SRP - multiple responsibilities
class User {
    void saveToDatabase() { /* database logic */ }
    void sendEmail() { /* email logic */ }
    void validateData() { /* validation logic */ }
}

// Follows SRP - single responsibility per class
class User {
    // User data and basic operations
}

class UserRepository {
    void saveToDatabase(User user) { /* database logic */ }
}

class EmailService {
    void sendEmail(String email, String message) { /* email logic */ }
}

class UserValidator {
    boolean validateData(User user) { /* validation logic */ }
}
```

#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
**Definition**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**Example**:
```java
// Using inheritance and polymorphism
abstract class Shape {
    abstract double calculateArea();
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    private double width, height;
    
    @Override
    double calculateArea() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    private double radius;
    
    @Override
    double calculateArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

// Adding new shapes doesn't require modifying existing code
class Triangle extends Shape {
    private double base, height;
    
    @Override
    double calculateArea() {
        return 0.5 * base * height;
    }
}
```

#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**Definition**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking functionality.

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
**Definition**: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
**Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

### 2. Other Design Principles

#### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
**Definition**: Avoid code duplication by extracting common functionality.

#### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
**Definition**: Design should be as simple as possible, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

#### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
**Definition**: Don't implement functionality until it's actually needed.

#### Separation of Concerns
**Definition**: Different aspects of a program should be separated into distinct sections.

#### High Cohesion, Low Coupling
- **High Cohesion**: Elements within a module work together toward a single purpose
- **Low Coupling**: Modules have minimal dependencies on each other

## Architectural Styles and Patterns

### 1. Layered Architecture

**Description**: Organizes system into horizontal layers, where each layer provides services to the layer above.

**Typical Layers**:
- Presentation Layer (UI)
- Business Logic Layer
- Data Access Layer
- Database Layer

**Advantages**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to understand and maintain
- Standardized structure

**Disadvantages**:
- Performance overhead
- Can become monolithic
- Changes may ripple through layers

**When to Use**:
- Traditional web applications
- Enterprise applications
- Systems with clear logical separation

### 2. Model-View-Controller (MVC)

**Description**: Separates application logic into three interconnected components.

**Components**:
- **Model**: Data and business logic
- **View**: User interface and presentation
- **Controller**: Handles user input and coordinates Model and View

**Advantages**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Supports multiple views
- Easier testing and maintenance

**Disadvantages**:
- Can become complex for simple applications
- Tight coupling between components
- May lead to fat controllers

### 3. Microservices Architecture

**Description**: Structures application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services.

**Characteristics**:
- Independent deployment
- Technology diversity
- Decentralized governance
- Failure isolation

**Advantages**:
- Scalability and flexibility
- Technology diversity
- Independent deployment
- Fault isolation

**Disadvantages**:
- Distributed system complexity
- Network latency
- Data consistency challenges
- Operational overhead

**When to Use**:
- Large, complex applications
- Multiple development teams

- High scalability requirements

### 4. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

**Description**: Designs software as a collection of interoperable services.

**Principles**:
- Service abstraction
- Service autonomy
- Service composability
- Service reusability

### 5. Event-Driven Architecture

**Description**: Uses events to trigger and communicate between decoupled services.

**Components**:
- Event producers
- Event consumers
- Event channels/brokers

**Advantages**:
- Loose coupling
- Scalability
- Flexibility

**Disadvantages**:
- Complexity in debugging
- Event ordering challenges
- Potential for event storms

## Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common design problems. They're categorized into three types:

### 1. Creational Patterns

#### Singleton Pattern
**Purpose**: Ensure a class has only one instance and provide global access to it.

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;
    
    private Singleton() {}
    
    public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

#### Factory Pattern
**Purpose**: Create objects without specifying their exact classes.

```java
interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Rectangle");
    }
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Circle");
    }
}

class ShapeFactory {
    public Shape createShape(String type) {
        switch (type.toLowerCase()) {
            case "rectangle": return new Rectangle();
            case "circle": return new Circle();
            default: throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown shape type");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Builder Pattern
**Purpose**: Construct complex objects step by step.

### 2. Structural Patterns

#### Adapter Pattern
**Purpose**: Allow incompatible interfaces to work together.

#### Decorator Pattern
**Purpose**: Add new functionality to objects dynamically without altering their structure.

#### Facade Pattern
**Purpose**: Provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

### 3. Behavioral Patterns

#### Observer Pattern
**Purpose**: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all dependents are notified.

```java
interface Observer {
    void update(String message);
}

class Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    
    public void addObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }
    
    public void removeObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }
    
    public void notifyObservers(String message) {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update(message);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Strategy Pattern
**Purpose**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.

#### Command Pattern
**Purpose**: Encapsulate a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests.

├─────────────────┤    ├─────────────────┤
│ - name: String  │1  *│ - balance: float│
│ - age: int      ├────┤ - accountNo: int│
├─────────────────┤    ├─────────────────┤
│ + getName()     │    │ + deposit()     │
│ + setAge()      │    │ + withdraw()    │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```
