# Software Testing

## Introduction

Software Testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software application or system does what it's supposed to do. The main purpose is to identify defects, gaps, or missing requirements in contrast to actual requirements.

## Importance of Software Testing

### Why Test Software?

1. **Bug Detection**: Find and fix defects before release
2. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure software meets requirements
3. **User Satisfaction**: Provide reliable, functional software
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Reduce business and technical risks
5. **Cost Reduction**: Fix bugs early when they're cheaper to fix
6. **Compliance**: Meet regulatory and industry standards

### Cost of Defects

The cost of fixing defects increases exponentially with each phase:
- **Requirements Phase**: 1x cost
- **Design Phase**: 5x cost
- **Implementation Phase**: 10x cost
- **Testing Phase**: 15x cost
- **Production**: 100x+ cost

## Testing Fundamentals

### 7 Principles of Software Testing

1. **Testing shows presence of defects**: Testing can prove defects exist but cannot prove they don't exist
2. **Exhaustive testing is impossible**: Testing all combinations is not feasible
3. **Early testing**: Start testing activities early in the development lifecycle
4. **Defect clustering**: Most defects are found in a small number of modules
5. **Pesticide paradox**: Same tests repeated won't find new bugs
6. **Testing is context dependent**: Different applications need different testing approaches
7. **Absence of errors fallacy**: A bug-free system might still be unusable

### Test Process

## Types of Testing

### Based on Knowledge of Code

#### 1. Black Box Testing
**Definition**: Testing without knowledge of internal structure or implementation.

**Techniques**:
- **Equivalence Partitioning**: Divide input data into equivalent partitions
- **Boundary Value Analysis**: Test at boundaries of input domains
- **Decision Table Testing**: Test different combinations of inputs
- **State Transition Testing**: Test state changes in the system

**Example - Equivalence Partitioning**:
```
Age validation (valid range: 18-65):
- Invalid partition 1: age < 18
- Valid partition: 18 ≤ age ≤ 65  
- Invalid partition 2: age > 65

Test cases: 10, 25, 70
```

#### 2. White Box Testing
**Definition**: Testing with complete knowledge of internal structure and implementation.

**Techniques**:
- **Statement Coverage**: Execute every line of code
- **Branch Coverage**: Execute every branch in the code
- **Path Coverage**: Execute every possible path through the code
- **Condition Coverage**: Test every condition in boolean expressions

**Example - Statement Coverage**:
```java
public int divide(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) {                    // Statement 1
        throw new ArithmeticException(); // Statement 2
    }
    return a / b;                    // Statement 3
}

// Test cases for 100% statement coverage:
// Test 1: divide(10, 2) -> covers statements 1, 3
// Test 2: divide(10, 0) -> covers statements 1, 2
```

#### 3. Gray Box Testing
**Definition**: Combination of black box and white box testing techniques.

### Based on Testing Levels

#### 1. Unit Testing
**Definition**: Testing individual components or modules in isolation.

**Characteristics**:
- Typically done by developers
- Fast execution
- High test coverage
- Uses mocks and stubs for dependencies

**Example**:
```java
@Test
public void testCalculateTotal() {
    // Arrange
    ShoppingCart cart = new ShoppingCart();
    cart.addItem(new Item("Book", 10.00));
    cart.addItem(new Item("Pen", 2.50));
    
    // Act
    double total = cart.calculateTotal();
    
    // Assert
    assertEquals(12.50, total, 0.01);
}
```

#### 2. Integration Testing
**Definition**: Testing the interfaces and interaction between integrated components.

**Types**:
- **Big Bang**: Integrate all components at once
- **Incremental**: 
  - Top-down integration
  - Bottom-up integration
  - Sandwich/Hybrid approach

**Example - API Integration Test**:
```java
@Test
public void testUserRegistrationIntegration() {
    // Test integration between UserController, UserService, and UserRepository
    UserRegistrationRequest request = new UserRegistrationRequest("john@example.com", "password");
    
    ResponseEntity<User> response = userController.register(request);
    
    assertEquals(HttpStatus.CREATED, response.getStatusCode());
    assertNotNull(response.getBody().getId());
    
    // Verify user is saved in database
    User savedUser = userRepository.findByEmail("john@example.com");
    assertNotNull(savedUser);
}
```

#### 3. System Testing
**Definition**: Testing the complete integrated system to verify it meets requirements.

**Types**:

2. Test values at, just below, and just above boundaries

**Example**:
```
Input: Age (1-100)
Boundary values to test: 0, 1, 2, 99, 100, 101
```

#### 3. Decision Table Testing
**Process**:
1. Identify conditions and actions
2. Create table with all combinations
3. Create test cases for each combination

**Example**:
```
Login System Decision Table:
Conditions:     | T1 | T2 | T3 | T4 |
Valid Username  | Y  | Y  | N  | N  |
Valid Password  | Y  | N  | Y  | N  |
Actions:        |    |    |    |    |
Grant Access    | X  |    |    |    |
Show Error      |    | X  | X  | X  |
```

### Structure-Based Techniques (White Box)
