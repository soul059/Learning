# Why can't we create an object of an abstract class or an interface?

This is a fundamental concept in Java's object-oriented design. The simple answer is: **both abstract classes and interfaces are considered incomplete contracts.** You cannot create an object from an incomplete blueprint.

Let's break down why for each one.

## 1. Why We Can't Instantiate an Abstract Class

An abstract class is a class that is declared with the `abstract` keyword and can have both abstract and concrete (regular) methods. An **abstract method** is a method that is declared without an implementation (it has no method body).

Think of an abstract class as a **partial or incomplete blueprint**.

### The Core Reason: Incomplete Implementation

Imagine you have an abstract class `Animal` with an abstract method `makeSound()`.

```java
public abstract class Animal {
    // A concrete method with implementation
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("This animal is sleeping... zzz");
    }

    // An abstract method - NO implementation!
    public abstract void makeSound();
}
```

The `makeSound()` method has no code inside it. It's a rule that says, "Any concrete subclass of `Animal` *must* provide an implementation for this method."

Now, suppose Java allowed you to create an object of `Animal`:

```java
// THIS IS NOT ALLOWED IN JAVA
Animal genericAnimal = new Animal(); 
```

What would happen if you tried to call the `makeSound()` method on this object?

```java
// What code would execute here? There is none!
genericAnimal.makeSound(); // Leads to a logical paradox.
```

Since `makeSound()` has no method body in the `Animal` class, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) would have no instructions to execute. This would be a logical error.

To prevent this situation, the Java compiler forbids the creation of objects from abstract classes. You must create an object of a **concrete subclass** that has completed the blueprint by implementing all abstract methods.

### Correct Usage:

```java
// Dog is a CONCRETE class because it implements the abstract method
public class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof woof!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // You can't do this:
        // Animal myAnimal = new Animal();

        // You must instantiate a concrete subclass
        Animal myDog = new Dog(); // This is valid
        myDog.makeSound(); // This correctly calls the Dog's implementation
        myDog.sleep();     // This calls the implemented method from the abstract Animal class
    }
}
```

## 2. Why We Can't Instantiate an Interface

An interface is even more abstract than an abstract class. Think of it as a **pure contract** or a **100% abstract blueprint**.

Before Java 8, an interface could *only* have abstract methods and constants. It had zero implementation details.

### The Core Reason: Purely a Contract

Consider an interface `Drivable`:

```java
public interface Drivable {
    void steer(int direction);
    void accelerate(int speed);
    void brake();
}
```

This interface is a set of rules. It says, "Any class that claims to be `Drivable` must know how to `steer`, `accelerate`, and `brake`." It provides absolutely no information on *how* to perform these actions.

If you were allowed to create an object of `Drivable`:

```java
// THIS IS NOT ALLOWED IN JAVA
Drivable genericDrivable = new Drivable();
```

And then tried to call a method:

```java
// What would happen? There is no implementation at all.
genericDrivable.accelerate(50); 
```

This is even more logically flawed than the abstract class example, as the interface provides no implementation whatsoever for its methods. It's just a contract. You can't create an object of a "contract"; you can only create an object of a class that *fulfills* the contract.

### Correct Usage:

```java
public class Car implements Drivable {
    @Override
    public void steer(int direction) {
        System.out.println("Car is steering.");
    }

    @Override
    public void accelerate(int speed) {
        System.out.println("Car is accelerating to " + speed + " mph.");
    }

    @Override
    public void brake() {
        System.out.println("Car is braking.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // You can't do this:
        // Drivable myDrivable = new Drivable();

        // You must instantiate a class that implements the interface
        Drivable myCar = new Car();
        myCar.accelerate(60);
    }
}
```

## Summary

| Feature          | Abstract Class                                       | Interface                                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Analogy**      | An incomplete blueprint                              | A pure contract or specification                     |
| **Reason for No Instantiation** | May contain abstract methods with no body. | All methods (pre-Java 8) are abstract with no body.  |
| **Purpose**      | To provide a common base for related subclasses.     | To define a contract of capabilities for a class.    |

In both cases, the rule is the same: **if a class or interface is not fully implemented, it cannot be instantiated.**
