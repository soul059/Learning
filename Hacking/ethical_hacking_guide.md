## 1. Introduction to Ethical Hacking {#introduction}

### What is Ethical Hacking?

Ethical hacking, also known as "white-hat hacking" or penetration testing, is the practice of legally and ethically testing computer systems, networks, and applications to find security vulnerabilities before malicious hackers do.

### Types of Hackers:
- **White Hat Hackers**: Ethical hackers who work to improve security
- **Black Hat Hackers**: Malicious hackers who exploit systems for personal gain
- **Gray Hat Hackers**: Fall between white and black hat, may find vulnerabilities without permission but don't exploit them maliciously

### Why Ethical Hacking Matters:
- Identifies security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited
- Helps organizations protect sensitive data
- Ensures compliance with security standards
- Saves companies millions in potential breach costs
