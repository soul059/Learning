### âœ¨ Key Takeaways:

* **Introduction to AWS Compute Services:** This section lays the groundwork for understanding how AWS provides computing power to run your applications. It's about choosing the right tool for the job.
* **Overview of Various Compute Options:**
    * **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** Virtual servers in the cloud (Infrastructure as a Service - IaaS). Think of it as renting a computer in the cloud.
    * **AWS Lambda:** Serverless compute service (Function as a Service - FaaS). Run code without provisioning or managing servers. You only pay when your code runs.
    * **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service):** Highly scalable, high-performance container orchestration service that supports Docker containers.
    * **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service):** A managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane.
    * **AWS Fargate:** Serverless compute engine for containers. It works with both ECS and EKS, allowing you to run containers without managing servers or clusters.
    * **AWS Elastic Beanstalk:** Platform as a Service (PaaS) for deploying and scaling web applications and services. It handles infrastructure provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring.
* **Use Cases for Different Compute Services:**
    * **EC2:** Ideal for custom operating systems, long-running applications, traditional servers, and when you need granular control over the infrastructure.
    * **Lambda:** Event-driven applications, serverless backends, data processing, IoT backends, chatbots.
    * **ECS/EKS/Fargate:** Microservices architectures, containerized applications, batch processing, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
    * **Elastic Beanstalk:** Rapid deployment of web applications without managing the underlying infrastructure, ideal for developers who want to focus on code.
* **Comparison of Compute Models:**
    * **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service - e.g., EC2):** You manage the operating system, applications, and data, while AWS manages the underlying infrastructure. Offers the most flexibility.
    * **PaaS (Platform as a Service - e.g., Elastic Beanstalk):** AWS manages the underlying infrastructure, operating system, and runtime environment. You focus on your application code. Simplifies deployment.
    * **FaaS (Function as a Service - e.g., Lambda):** AWS manages everything below your code. You only provide your code and it runs in response to events. Most abstracted and scales automatically.

### âœ¨ Key Takeaways:

* **Introduction to Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** EC2 provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It's like having a virtual server that you can spin up and down as needed.
* **EC2 Instance Types:** AWS offers a variety of instance types optimized for different use cases:
    * **General Purpose:** Balanced compute, memory, and networking resources (e.g., T, M series - `t2.micro`, `m5.large`). Good for web servers, small databases.
    * **Compute Optimized:** Ideal for compute-intensive applications (e.g., C series - `c5.xlarge`). Good for batch processing, high-performance computing (HPC).
    * **Memory Optimized:** Designed for memory-intensive applications (e.g., R, X, Z series - `r5.xlarge`). Good for high-performance databases, in-memory caches.
    * **Storage Optimized:** For workloads requiring high sequential read and write access to very large datasets on local storage (e.g., I, D, H series). Good for data warehousing, distributed file systems.
    * **Accelerated Computing:** Uses hardware accelerators (like GPUs) to perform functions such as floating-point calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching (e.g., P, G, F series). Good for machine learning, video encoding.
* **AMI (Amazon Machine Image) Concepts:** An AMI provides the information required to launch an instance. It's a template that includes:
    * A template for the root volume for the instance (e.g., an operating system, application server, and applications).
    * Launch permissions that control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch instances.
    * A block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attach to the instance when it's launched.
* **Security Groups and Network ACLs Basics:**
    * **Security Groups:** Act as virtual firewalls at the instance level. They control inbound and outbound traffic for one or more instances. They are stateful (return traffic is automatically allowed). **"Allow" rules only.**
    * **Network ACLs (NACLs):** Operate at the subnet level. They are stateless (return traffic must be explicitly allowed by rules). Can have both **"Allow" and "Deny" rules.**
* **Launching an EC2 Instance:** The process involves choosing an AMI, selecting an instance type, configuring network settings, adding storage, setting up security groups, and reviewing and launching.

### âœ¨ Key Takeaways:

* **EC2 Storage Options:**
    * **EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volumes:** Network-attached storage that can be attached to EC2 instances. They persist independently of the life of the instance.
        * **Root Volumes:** The primary storage device for an EC2 instance, typically an EBS volume.
        * **Additional EBS Volumes:** Can be attached for more storage capacity.
    * **Instance Store:** Provides temporary block-level storage for your instance. Data on instance store volumes persists only during the life of the instance. Ideal for temporary storage of data that changes frequently.
* **EBS Volume Types:**
    * **General Purpose SSD (gp2/gp3):** Balances price and performance for a wide variety of transactional workloads. Good for boot volumes, dev/test environments.
    * **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2):** Highest-performance SSD volumes for critical, transactional applications that require sustained IOPS performance (e.g., large databases).
    * **Throughput Optimized HDD (st1):** Low-cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads (e.g., big data, log processing).
    * **Cold HDD (sc1):** Lowest-cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads (e.g., archiving, cold data storage).
* **Snapshots and AMIs:**
    * **EBS Snapshots:** Point-in-time backups of your EBS volumes stored in Amazon S3. They are incremental, meaning only changed blocks are saved. Can be used to restore volumes or create new volumes.
    * **AMIs from Snapshots:** You can create an AMI from an EBS snapshot, allowing you to quickly launch new instances with the same configuration and data.
* **Elastic IPs:** A static, public IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. It's associated with your AWS account rather than a specific instance, meaning you can remap it to another instance if the original fails or is replaced, providing fault tolerance. **Note:** You are charged for unused Elastic IPs.
* **Placement Groups:** A logical grouping of instances that helps you to place your instances in a way that best meets the needs of your workload.
    * **Cluster Placement Group:** Clusters instances within a single Availability Zone for low-latency network performance. Ideal for HPC.
    * **Spread Placement Group:** Spreads instances across underlying hardware to reduce correlated failures. Good for applications requiring high availability.
    * **Partition Placement Group:** Spreads your instances across different racks within an Availability Zone. Each rack is called a partition. Each partition has its own power source and network. Good for large distributed and replicated workloads.

### âœ¨ Key Takeaways:

* **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG):** Allows you to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances in your application based on demand.
    * **Scaling Policies:** Define when and how your ASG scales (e.g., target tracking, simple scaling, step scaling).
    * **Health Checks:** ASGs automatically replace unhealthy instances, ensuring application availability.
    * **Benefits:** High availability, fault tolerance, cost optimization by scaling out during peak times and scaling in during low times.
* **Load Balancers (ELB - Elastic Load Balancing):** Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets (e.g., EC2 instances) in multiple Availability Zones.
    * **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Operates at Layer 7 (application layer). Ideal for HTTP/HTTPS traffic, microservices, and container-based applications. Supports path-based routing, host-based routing, and target groups.
    * **Network Load Balancer (NLB):** Operates at Layer 4 (transport layer). Handles millions of requests per second with ultra-low latency. Ideal for high-performance applications, gaming services, and when you need static IP addresses.
    * **Classic Load Balancer (CLB):** Older generation load balancer. Supports both Layer 4 and Layer 7. Generally recommended to use ALB or NLB for new applications.
* **Target Groups:** Used with ALBs and NLBs to route requests to one or more registered targets. Each target group routes requests to a specific port on one or more registered targets.
* **Cost Implications of EC2:** Understanding different pricing models is crucial for cost optimization.
    * **On-Demand Instances:** Pay by the hour or second for instances that you use. Ideal for short-term, irregular workloads where you can't commit to a longer-term contract.
    * **Reserved Instances (RIs):** Commit to a one-year or three-year term for a significant discount compared to On-Demand. Best for steady-state workloads.
        * **Standard RIs:** Offer a discount, but cannot be changed after purchase.
        * **Convertible RIs:** Offer a smaller discount than Standard RIs, but can be exchanged for another Convertible RI with different attributes.
    * **Spot Instances:** Bid on unused EC2 capacity. Very low cost but can be interrupted with two minutes' notice. Ideal for fault-tolerant, flexible applications (e.g., batch jobs, data analysis).
    * **Savings Plans:** Flexible pricing model that offers lower prices on EC2 usage (and Fargate, Lambda) in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of compute usage (measured in $/hour) for a 1-year or 3-year term. More flexible than RIs as they apply across instance families, sizes, OS, and even regions (for EC2).

    * **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service):** A managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. Ideal if you're already familiar with Kubernetes or need its advanced features.
    * **Fargate:** A serverless compute engine for containers that works with both ECS and EKS. With Fargate, you don't need to provision, configure, or scale clusters of virtual machines. You only pay for the compute resources consumed by your containers.
* **Use Cases for Each Service:**
    * **ECS:** Simpler to get started for container orchestration on AWS. Good for existing AWS users who want native integration.
    * **EKS:** Best for organizations that are already using Kubernetes, or want to leverage the broader Kubernetes ecosystem and its powerful features.
    * **Fargate:** Ideal for applications that need to scale rapidly, have unpredictable traffic patterns, or when you want to minimize operational overhead of managing servers.
* **Basic Architecture of Containerized Applications on AWS:**
    * Often involves an Elastic Load Balancer (ALB) distributing traffic to ECS/EKS services running on EC2 instances or Fargate.
    * Container images are stored in Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry).

## ðŸ”— Section 7 Video - Introduction to AWS Lambda

### âœ¨ Key Takeaways:

* **Introduction to Serverless Computing:**
    * **Definition:** A cloud execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. You don't need to provision or manage any servers.
    * **Benefits:** No server management, automatic scaling, pay-per-execution (cost efficiency), increased developer productivity.
* **What is AWS Lambda?**
    * A serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You just upload your code, and Lambda handles everything required to run and scale your code with high availability.
    * **Event-Driven:** Lambda functions are triggered by events from other AWS services (e.g., S3 object uploads, DynamoDB table updates, API Gateway requests) or custom events.
* **Lambda Functions, Triggers, and Invocation Models:**
    * **Lambda Function:** The code that runs when triggered. You specify the runtime (Node.js, Python, Java, Go, C#, Ruby, custom runtimes).
    * **Triggers:** The AWS service or custom event source that invokes your Lambda function. Examples: S3 bucket events, DynamoDB streams, API Gateway, CloudWatch Events.
    * **Invocation Models:**
        * **Synchronous Invocation:** The caller waits for the Lambda function to execute and return a response (e.g., API Gateway).
        * **Asynchronous Invocation:** The caller doesn't wait for a response. Lambda queues the event and retries on failure (e.g., S3 event notifications).
        * **Event Source Mapping (Polling):** Lambda polls a stream or queue for new events (e.g., Kinesis, SQS, DynamoDB Streams).
* **Use Cases for Lambda:**
    * **Event-driven architectures:** Responding to changes in data, file uploads, etc.
    * **Backend for mobile/web apps:** Providing APIs without managing web servers.
    * **Data processing:** Real-time stream processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks.
    * **IoT backends:** Processing data from IoT devices.
    * **Chatbots:** Handling conversational interfaces.
    * **Automated tasks:** Running scheduled jobs or responding to operational events.
* **Cost Model of Lambda:**
    * You pay only for the compute time consumed by your functions.
    * Costs are based on:
        * **Number of requests:** How many times your function is invoked.
        * **Duration:** The time your code executes (billed in milliseconds).
        * **Memory allocated:** The amount of memory you configure for your function.
