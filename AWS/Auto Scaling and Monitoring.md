## ðŸ”— Section 1 Video - Elastic Load Balancing

### âœ¨ Key Takeaways:

This section introduces Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), a service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones. This enhances the availability and fault tolerance of your applications.

* **Introduction to Elastic Load Balancing (ELB):**
    * **Definition:** A service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple healthy targets.
    * **Purpose:**
        * **High Availability:** Distributes traffic across instances in different Availability Zones to ensure your application remains available even if one AZ experiences an outage.
        * **Fault Tolerance:** Routes traffic only to healthy instances, automatically taking unhealthy instances out of rotation.
        * **Scalability:** Works with Auto Scaling to handle varying levels of application load.
* **Types of Load Balancers:** AWS offers different types of load balancers, each optimized for specific use cases:
    * **Application Load Balancer (ALB):**
        * **Layer 7 Load Balancer:** Operates at the application layer (HTTP/HTTPS).
        * **Features:** Ideal for flexible application architectures like microservices and container-based applications. Supports:
            * **Path-based routing:** Routes requests based on the URL path (e.g., `/users` to one group of instances, `/products` to another).
            * **Host-based routing:** Routes requests based on the hostname in the HTTP header (e.g., `api.example.com` to one group, `web.example.com` to another).
            * **Target Groups:** You register targets (EC2 instances, IP addresses, Lambda functions) with target groups, and the ALB routes traffic to these groups.
            * **HTTP/HTTPS support:** Handles SSL termination.
    * **Network Load Balancer (NLB):**
        * **Layer 4 Load Balancer:** Operates at the transport layer (TCP, UDP, TLS).
        * **Features:** Designed for extreme performance and ultra-low latency. Supports:
            * **High Throughput:** Can handle millions of requests per second.
            * **Static IP Addresses:** Provides a static IP address per Availability Zone.
            * **Direct IP Address Routing:** Routes connections to targets directly via IP address.
            * **Ideal for:** High-performance applications, gaming services, IoT backends, and when you need consistent network performance.
    * **Classic Load Balancer (CLB):**
        * **Older Generation:** Supports both Layer 4 (TCP) and Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) features.
        * **Recommendation:** Generally recommended to use ALB or NLB for new applications due to their more advanced features and better performance. CLB is still available for legacy applications.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * **Listeners:** A process that checks for connection requests, using the protocol and port that you configure.
    * **Target Groups:** A logical grouping of targets (e.g., EC2 instances, IP addresses) that receive traffic from a load balancer. You define health checks per target group.
    * **Health Checks:** Load balancers regularly monitor the health of registered targets. If a target fails health checks, it's automatically taken out of rotation until it becomes healthy again.
* **Integration with Auto Scaling:** ELB seamlessly integrates with Auto Scaling Groups to dynamically add or remove instances as traffic fluctuates.

## ðŸ”— Section 3 Video - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling

### âœ¨ Key Takeaways:

This section delves into Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, a powerful service that automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in your application based on demand, helping you maintain application availability and optimize costs.

* **Introduction to Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling:**
    * **Definition:** A service that helps you automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances in your Auto Scaling Group (ASG) based on defined conditions.
    * **Purpose:**
        * **Maintain Application Availability:** Ensures your application always has the right amount of capacity to handle current traffic demand.
        * **Cost Optimization:** Saves money by launching instances only when needed and terminating them when demand drops, paying only for the capacity you use.
        * **Fault Tolerance:** Automatically replaces unhealthy instances, ensuring continuous application availability.
* **Key EC2 Auto Scaling Components:**
    * **Auto Scaling Group (ASG):**
        * **Definition:** A collection of EC2 instances that are treated as a logical unit for the purpose of scaling and management.
        * **Core Configuration:**
            * **Launch Configuration or Launch Template:** Specifies the instance type, AMI, security groups, key pair, user data, and other parameters for new instances launched by the ASG. **Launch Templates are the newer and recommended option** as they support more features (e.g., mixed instance types).
            * **Desired Capacity:** The target number of instances for the ASG.
            * **Minimum Capacity:** The minimum number of instances that must always be running.
            * **Maximum Capacity:** The maximum number of instances the ASG can scale out to.
            * **VPC Subnets:** Specifies which subnets (and thus which Availability Zones) the ASG can launch instances into. For high availability, instances should be distributed across multiple AZs.
    * **Scaling Policies:** Define when and how your ASG scales.
        * **Simple Scaling:** Triggered by a CloudWatch alarm. When the alarm state is reached, the ASG adds or removes a specified number of instances. (e.g., "Add 2 instances when CPU > 70%").
        * **Step Scaling:** More flexible than simple scaling. Allows you to define different scaling adjustments for different alarm breach sizes (e.g., "Add 1 instance if CPU is 60-70%, add 3 instances if CPU is > 80%").
        * **Target Tracking Scaling:** The most common and recommended policy. You choose a metric and a target value (e.g., "Keep average CPU utilization at 60%"). Auto Scaling automatically adjusts the number of instances to maintain this target. It's intelligent and proactive.
        * **Scheduled Scaling:** Allows you to scale your ASG based on a predictable schedule (e.g., "Increase capacity by 5 instances every weekday at 9 AM and decrease by 5 instances at 5 PM"). Ideal for known traffic patterns.
    * **Health Checks:**
        * **EC2 Health Checks:** Monitors the status of the underlying EC2 instance (e.g., system status checks, instance status checks).
        * **ELB Health Checks:** If integrated with an Elastic Load Balancer, the ASG can use the ELB's health checks to determine if instances are healthy from the application's perspective. If an instance fails ELB health checks, the ASG will terminate and replace it.
* **Benefits of EC2 Auto Scaling:**
    * **High Availability:** Automatically replaces unhealthy instances and distributes load across AZs.
    * **Fault Tolerance:** Resilient to instance failures.
    * **Cost Efficiency:** Scales capacity up during peak times and scales down during idle periods, preventing over-provisioning and reducing costs.
    * **Improved Performance:** Ensures consistent performance by adjusting to demand.
    * **Simplified Management:** Automates the scaling process, reducing manual intervention.
* **Integration with ELB and CloudWatch:**
    * **ELB:** Auto Scaling Groups register their instances with an ELB, allowing the load balancer to distribute traffic across the dynamically scaled instances. ELB health checks can inform ASG scaling.
    * **CloudWatch:** ASG uses CloudWatch alarms to trigger scaling policies based on metrics like CPU utilization, network I/O, or custom application metrics.
