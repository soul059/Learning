# User Management in Linux

Effective user management is fundamental for Linux system administration and security. It involves creating, modifying, and deleting user and group accounts, and controlling how users execute commands with different privilege levels. This is crucial for enforcing access controls and maintaining system integrity.

## Executing Commands as Another User

Certain tasks require elevated privileges that a standard user account might not have, such as viewing sensitive system files like `/etc/shadow` (which contains encrypted password information and is typically only readable by root). Linux provides commands to execute tasks with the permissions of a different user.

* **`sudo`**:
    * **Description:** "superuser do". Allows a permitted user to execute a command with the privileges of another user, by default the `root` user.
    * **Purpose:** Enables users to perform administrative tasks securely without logging in directly as root. A best practice for managing permissions.
    * **Example (Attempting to view `/etc/shadow` without `sudo`):**
        ```bash
        cat /etc/shadow
        # Output: cat: /etc/shadow: Permission denied
        ```
    * **Example (Viewing `/etc/shadow` with `sudo`):**
        ```bash
        sudo cat /etc/shadow
        # (Prompts for the user's password if required, then displays content)
        # Output: root:%3CSNIP%3E:18395:0:99999:7:::
        # ... (other user entries)
        ```
    * **Note:** `sudo` permissions are configured in the `/etc/sudoers` file, determining which users can run which commands as which other users.

* **`su`**:
    * **Description:** "substitute user" or "switch user". Switches to another user ID and starts a new shell session with that user's environment and privileges.
    * **Purpose:** Allows logging in as another user from the current terminal session. If no username is specified, it defaults to the `root` user.
    * **Note:** Requires the password of the user you are switching to.

## Other Key User and Group Management Commands

System administrators use several other commands to manage accounts:

* **`useradd`**: Creates a new user account on the system.
* **`userdel`**: Deletes a user account, optionally removing their home directory and mail spool.
* **`usermod`**: Modifies an existing user account (e.g., change username, change home directory, add/remove from groups).
* **`addgroup`**: Creates a new group on the system.
* **`delgroup`**: Deletes a group from the system.
* **`passwd`**: Changes the password for a user account.

## Practice and Security

Understanding user management is essential for identifying potential security vulnerabilities and assessing the security posture of a Linux system. Misconfigurations in user accounts, group memberships, or `sudo` privileges can lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

Practicing these commands in a controlled environment, such as the provided target system, is highly recommended. Experiment with creating users, assigning them to groups, and applying previously learned commands (like file permissions, filtering, and redirection) in scenarios involving different user accounts. The ability to reset the target system allows for safe exploration and learning through experimentation.>)
