# Linux Security

Securing Linux systems is paramount due to the inherent risk of intrusion, especially for internet-facing servers. While Linux systems are generally considered less susceptible to certain threats than others, fundamental security practices are essential for all installations.

## Fundamental Linux Security Measures

Several key practices form the basis of securing a Linux system:

* **Keeping the System Updated:** Regularly updating the operating system and all installed packages is crucial for patching vulnerabilities.
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade
    ```
    (Updates package lists and upgrades installed packages on Debian-based systems)

* **Firewalls (`iptables` / `ufw`):** Implementing firewall rules to restrict incoming and outgoing network traffic at the host level.
* **Securing SSH:**
    * Disable password-based authentication in favor of more secure SSH key-based authentication.
    * Prevent direct root login via SSH.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Granting users only the minimum set of permissions required to perform their tasks.
* **Sudo Configuration:** Instead of giving users full root access, configure the `/etc/sudoers` file to allow specific users to run specific commands with elevated privileges using `sudo`.
* **Fail2ban:** A tool that monitors log files for failed login attempts (e.g., SSH) and automatically bans the source IP address after a configured number of failures, mitigating brute-force attacks.
* **Regular System Auditing:** Periodically check for security weaknesses that could facilitate privilege escalation, such as:
    * Out-of-date kernel versions (some may require manual updates).
    * Incorrect user permissions or group memberships.
    * World-writable files (`-rw-rw-rw-` or permissions allowing any user to write).
    * Misconfigured cron jobs or services.
    * Weak passwords.

* **General Security Settings:**
    * Remove or disable unnecessary services and installed software to reduce the attack surface.
    * Disable services that use unencrypted authentication mechanisms (like older FTP or Telnet).
    * Ensure time synchronization is enabled (NTP) and system logs are being collected (Syslog).
    * Ensure each user has a unique account.
    * Enforce strong password policies, including password aging and preventing reuse of old passwords.
    * Configure account locking after a certain number of failed login attempts.
    * Identify and disable unnecessary SUID/SGID binaries that could be exploited.

Security is an ongoing process, requiring continuous effort and administrator knowledge.

## Mandatory Access Control (MAC) Systems

MAC systems enforce access control policies based on security labels and rules, providing a more rigid security model than Discretionary Access Control (DAC).

* **SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux):**
    * **Type:** Kernel-level MAC system.
    * **Mechanism:** Labels all system objects (processes, files, directories) and enforces policies that define how labeled subjects (processes) can interact with labeled objects.
    * **Benefit:** Limits the potential damage a compromised process can cause by restricting its access based on policy. Offers very granular control.
    * **Characteristic:** Powerful but often complex to configure and manage.

* **AppArmor:**
    * **Type:** Kernel-level MAC system, implemented as a Linux Security Module (LSM).
    * **Mechanism:** Uses application-specific profiles to define what resources (files, network ports, capabilities) an application is allowed to access.
    * **Characteristic:** Generally considered easier to configure and manage than SELinux, profile-based.

Both SELinux and AppArmor enhance security by limiting application behavior, but they differ in implementation and complexity.

## TCP Wrappers

TCP wrappers provide a host-based network access control layer for specific network services.

* **Purpose:** Restrict access to services based on the client's hostname or IP address.
* **Mechanism:** Intercepts connection attempts to configured services and checks rules in two configuration files.
* **Configuration Files:**
    * `/etc/hosts.allow`: Lists services and clients that are **allowed** to connect.
    * `/etc/hosts.deny`: Lists services and clients that are **denied** connection.
* **Rule Processing:** When a connection attempt is made, the system checks the rules. The first rule that matches the requested service and connecting client determines whether the connection is allowed or denied. Rules in `hosts.allow` for a specific service are typically checked before rules in `hosts.deny` for the same service.
* **Rule Syntax:** `service : client`
    * `service`: The name of the service (e.g., `sshd`, `ftpd`, `telnetd`, `ALL` for all services).
    * `client`: The hostname, IP address, network range (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`), or keyword (`ALL` for any client) of the connecting host. Can also use domain names (`.example.com`).

* **Example (`/etc/hosts.allow`):**
    ```ini
    # Allow access to SSH from the 10.129.14.0/24 network
    sshd : 10.129.14.0/24
    # Allow access to FTP from the host 10.129.14.10
    ftpd : 10.129.14.10
    # Allow access to Telnet from any host in the inlanefreight.local domain
    telnetd : .inlanefreight.local
```


* **Example (`/etc/hosts.deny`):**
    ```ini
    # Deny access to all services from any host in the inlanefreight.com domain
    ALL : .inlanefreight.com
    # Deny access to SSH from the specific host 10.129.22.22
    sshd : 10.129.22.22
    # Deny access to FTP from hosts with IP addresses in the range of 10.129.22.0 to 10.129.22.255
    ftpd : 10.129.22.0/24
```

* **Limitation:** TCP wrappers control access at the service layer, not the port layer. They are not a full replacement for a network firewall.

Understanding and implementing these security measures, including updating, configuring firewalls, securing access methods like SSH, applying the principle of least privilege, regularly auditing, and utilizing MAC systems and TCP wrappers, is fundamental for hardening Linux systems and protecting them from potential threats. Practical experimentation with these tools in a safe environment is highly recommended.>)
