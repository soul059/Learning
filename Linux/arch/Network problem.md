To connect to Ethernet in KDE Plasma on Arch Linux, you can use **NetworkManager**, which is the recommended tool for managing network connections. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Install NetworkManager** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S networkmanager
   ```
2. **Enable and start NetworkManager**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable --now NetworkManager
   ```
3. **Check available network interfaces**:
   ```bash
   nmcli device status
   ```
   Your Ethernet interface should be listed (e.g., `eth0` or `enpXsY`).
4. **Connect to Ethernet**:
   ```bash
   nmcli device connect %3Cinterface_name%3E
   ```
   Replace `<interface_name>` with your actual Ethernet interface name.
5. **Verify connection**:
   ```bash
   nmcli connection show
   ```
   If connected, your Ethernet connection should be listed.

Alternatively, you can use **System Settings** in KDE Plasma to manage network connections via a graphical interface. Navigate to **System Settings > Connections**, where you can configure Ethernet settings.

# More complex requirement

Okay, if `dhcpcd` or `dhclient` are not installed, the easiest way to get network connectivity back is to use the Arch installation medium to `chroot` into your installed system and install a DHCP client or a network manager.

Here's the process:

1.  **Boot from the Arch Installation Medium:**
    * Insert the USB drive or DVD you used to install Arch Linux.
    * Restart your computer and boot from the installation medium. You'll be in the Arch live environment.

2.  **Identify Your Partitions:**
    Once in the live environment, you need to identify your root partition. Run:
    ```bash
    lsblk
    ```
    Look for your disks and partitions based on their size and mount points (though they won't be mounted yet in the live environment). Your root partition is the one where you installed the main system files (usually mounted as `/` during installation). It's often the largest Linux partition on your disk. It might look something like `/dev/sda2`, `/dev/nvme0n1p2`, etc.

3.  **Mount Your Root Partition:**
    Mount your root partition to `/mnt`. Replace `/dev/sdXn` with the actual name of your root partition:
    ```bash
    mount /dev/sdXn /mnt
    ```
    If you have separate partitions for other directories like `/boot`, `/home`, etc., you should mount those as well under `/mnt`. For example:
    ```bash
    mount /dev/sdXm /mnt/boot # If you have a separate boot partition
    mount /dev/sdXp /mnt/home # If you have a separate home partition
    # Mount EFI system partition if you have one and used UEFI boot
    mount /dev/sdXq /mnt/boot/efi
    ```

4.  **Chroot into Your Installed System:**
    Now, change the root into your installed system:
    ```bash
    arch-chroot /mnt
    ```

5.  **Connect to the Internet (within chroot):**
    While you are in the `arch-chroot` environment, you will be using the kernel and tools from the live environment, which *should* have network tools like `dhcpcd` or `iwctl` available.
    * **Wired:** If using wired, it might connect automatically. If not, try:
        ```bash
        ip link # Identify wired interface name (e.g., eth0, enpXsY)
        ip link set your_wired_interface_name up
        dhcpcd your_wired_interface_name
        ```
    * **Wireless:** If using wireless, use `iwctl`:
        ```bash
        iwctl
        # In iwctl prompt:
        # device list
        # station your_device_name scan
        # station your_device_name get-networks
        # station your_device_name connect "Your_SSID"
        # (enter password if prompted)
        # quit
        ```
    Verify the connection within the chroot environment by pinging:
    ```bash
    ping google.com
    ```

6.  **Install Network Tools:**
    Once you have internet access within the `chroot` environment, install a DHCP client or a network manager into your installed system. Installing `NetworkManager` is often recommended for ease of use, especially with wireless.
    ```bash
    pacman -S dhcpcd  # To install dhcpcd
    ```
    OR
    ```bash
    pacman -S networkmanager # To install NetworkManager
    ```

7.  **Exit Chroot and Reboot:**
    After the installation is complete, exit the chroot environment:
    ```bash
    exit
    ```
    Unmount the partitions:
    ```bash
    umount -R /mnt
    ```
    Reboot your system:
    ```bash
    reboot
    ```
    Remember to remove the installation medium so your computer boots into your newly installed Arch system.

8.  **Enable Network Service (after rebooting into your installed system):**
    Once you've rebooted into your installed Arch system, you need to enable the service for the network tool you installed so it starts automatically on boot.

    * If you installed `dhcpcd`:
        ```bash
        systemctl enable dhcpcd.service
        systemctl start dhcpcd.service
        ```
    * If you installed `NetworkManager`:
        ```bash
        systemctl enable NetworkManager.service
        systemctl start NetworkManager.service
        ```

After these steps, your system should connect to the internet automatically on boot (for wired with DHCP) or you can use `nmcli`, `nmtui`, or a graphical network manager to connect to Wi-Fi if you installed `NetworkManager`.
