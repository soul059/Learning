Preprocessor directives in C and C++ are instructions that are executed by the preprocessor before the actual compilation of code begins. They help modify the code or include external resources, making programs easier to manage and more efficient.

### Types of Preprocessor Directives:
1. **File Inclusion Directives**:
   - Use `#include` to include the contents of another file (usually header files).
   - Example:
     ```c
     #include <stdio.h>   // Includes standard library header
     #include "myheader.h" // Includes a user-defined header
     ```

2. **Macro Definition**:
   - Use `#define` to create macros, which are named constants or code fragments that replace text during preprocessing.
   - Example:
     ```c
     #define PI 3.14
     #define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))  // Macro function
     ```

3. **Conditional Compilation**:
   - Use directives like `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#else`, `#elif`, and `#endif` to conditionally compile parts of the program based on certain conditions.
   - Example:
     ```c
     #ifdef DEBUG
     printf("Debugging enabled!\n");
     #endif
     ```

4. **Line Control**:
   - Use `#line` to modify the current line number or filename in error messages.
   - Example:
     ```c
     #line 100 "custom_file_name"
     ```

5. **Error Directive**:
   - Use `#error` to generate a custom compilation error if certain conditions aren't met.
   - Example:
     ```c
     #ifndef VERSION
     #error "VERSION is not defined"
     #endif
     ```

6. **Pragma Directive**:
   - Use `#pragma` to specify additional instructions for the compiler (platform-specific features).
   - Example:
     ```c
     #pragma pack(1) // Changes memory alignment
     ```

### Summary:
These directives provide flexibility, control, and efficiency in programming, allowing you to include files, define constants or macros, and control what parts of the code are compiled based on conditions.
