The **if-elseif-else** structure (also known as **if-elif-else** in Python or similar variations in other programming languages) is used when you have multiple conditions to evaluate. It allows you to check several possible conditions one by one, and execute different blocks of code for each.

### Here's how it works:
1. The `if` block checks the first condition. If itâ€™s true, the corresponding block of code is executed, and the rest is skipped.
2. If the `if` condition is false, the `elseif` (or `elif`) block checks the next condition, and so on.
3. If none of the conditions are true, the `else` block executes as the fallback.

### Example in Python:
```python
score = 75

if score >= 90:
    print("You got an A!")
elif score >= 75:
    print("You got a B!")
elif score >= 60:
    print("You got a C!")
else:
    print("You need to improve.")
```

### Example in C:
```c
int score = 75;

if (score >= 90) {
    printf("You got an A!\n");
} else if (score >= 75) {
    printf("You got a B!\n");
} else if (score >= 60) {
    printf("You got a C!\n");
} else {
    printf("You need to improve.\n");
}
```

### Explanation:
- If `score` is **90 or more**, the first condition is true, and it prints "You got an A!"
- If `score` is **75 or more** but less than 90, it prints "You got a B!"
- If `score` is **60 or more** but less than 75, it prints "You got a C!"
- If none of these are true, it falls to the `else` block and prints "You need to improve."

This structure is super handy when you need to evaluate multiple conditions in a clear and organized way.
