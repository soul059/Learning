--> just best content of c language is in [github](https://github.com/soul059/C-language) so start with [basic of c](https://github.com/soul059/C-language/blob/main/basic%20program%20but%20importent/basic.c)

### **Basic**

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
	printf("Hello world");
}
```

Here **main** [[Function]] is important because It's **start of our program**.

`#include <stdio.h>` it's a header file It's just include simple function like `printf , scanf`.

--> [[Data types]].
--> [[Operator]].

know more about [[Preprocessor directives]].

Also for basic stuff [[if-else]] , [[loops]] 

Advance stuff like [[Structures]] , [[Union]] , [[Pointers]] , [[C File IO]]

[[Dynamic memory allocation]]

you can also use [[Recursion]] 

C language does not support [[Object Oriented Programing (OOP)]]
