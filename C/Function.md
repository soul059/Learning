--> Good file on [github](https://github.com/soul059/C-language/blob/main/function/function%20inc.c) about function It's in c but that is basic understanding of functions

Function is just an block of code that just take some input do work on that input and return output

```C
int funAdd(int a,int b){
	return a + b;
}
/*
basic sintax of a C funcations is written as follows:
    return_type name(data_type parameter 1 ,data_type parameter 2,..) {
        code......
	}
*/
```

Here is an function which take an integer (Number) value and return an integer value because we specified it that it will return int

**In different language just [[Syntax]] change**
