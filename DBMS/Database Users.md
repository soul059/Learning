# Database Users

[[DBMS|Database systems]] serve various users within an organization, each interacting with the database in different ways based on their roles, technical expertise, and needs. Understanding the different types of users helps in designing appropriate interfaces, security measures, and database structures.

Common categories of database users include:

* **Naïve Users (End Users):**
    * **Description:** These users interact with the database through pre-written application programs that provide user-friendly interfaces (like forms, reports, web pages, mobile apps). They do not need to know the underlying database structure or query languages.
    * **Interaction:** They invoke existing operations by clicking buttons, filling out forms, or navigating application menus.
    * **Examples:** Bank tellers using account management software, airline reservation agents, online shoppers, employees using internal company applications (HR, inventory).
    * **Relation to SQL:** Their interactions are translated into [[SQL DML|SQL]] commands (like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`) by the application program, which communicates with the [[DBMS]].

* **Sophisticated Users:**
    * **Description:** These users have a good understanding of the database structure and can formulate ad-hoc queries to retrieve needed information using database query languages (primarily [[SQL]]).
    * **Interaction:** They directly write queries (e.g., using a database client tool or a query interface).
    * **Examples:** Data analysts, data scientists, business intelligence professionals, engineers, researchers.
    * **Relation to SQL:** They extensively use [[SQL DQL]] (`SELECT`) and potentially other DML commands for exploratory analysis.

* **Application Programmers:**
    * **Description:** These are IT professionals who design, develop, and maintain the application programs used by [[Database Users#Naïve Users (End Users)|naïve users]].
    * **Interaction:** They write code that embeds [[SQL]] statements within a host programming language (like Java, Python, C#). They define the logic that interacts with the database.
    * **Examples:** Software developers building enterprise applications, web developers.
    * **Relation to SQL:** They use all categories of [[SQL]] (DDL, DML, DQL) within their application code, often utilizing database connectors (like ODBC, JDBC).

* **Specialized Users:**
    * **Description:** These users write specialized database applications that don't fit into traditional data processing frameworks. This often involves complex data types or unique requirements.
    * **Interaction:** They develop custom software that interacts with the database using specialized interfaces or programming techniques.
    * **Examples:** Users of CAD systems, knowledge-based systems, GIS systems, multimedia database applications.
    * **Relation to SQL:** May use extensions to [[SQL]] or specific database APIs designed for their application domain.

* **Database Administrator (DBA):**
    * **Description:** The professional responsible for the overall management and administration of the database system. (See [[Database Administrator (DBA)]]).
    * **Interaction:** Interacts directly with the [[DBMS]] and operating system to perform tasks like schema management, security, backup/recovery, performance tuning.
    * **Relation to SQL:** Uses [[SQL DDL]], [[SQL DCL]], [[SQL TCL]], and specialized administrative commands provided by the DBMS.

Different user types highlight the need for the [[DBMS]] to provide various interfaces and levels of abstraction (See [[View of Data (Data Abstraction)]] / [[Database Concepts#Data Independence|Data Independence]]) to cater to diverse needs while maintaining [[Database Concepts#Increased Data Security|security]] and [[Database Concepts#Enhanced Data Integrity|integrity]].
