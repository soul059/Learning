# Data Isolation

**Data Isolation** refers to data being scattered in various files or databases with different formats, making it difficult to access and integrate related information. This was a significant problem in the [[File Oriented Approach]].

## Isolation in File Systems

In file-oriented systems:

* **Scattered Data:** Data was stored in numerous independent files, often specific to particular applications or departments.
* **Varied Formats:** Files were created by different programmers using different file formats, data structures, and programming languages over time. There was no standard way to represent or access data across the organization.
* **Application-Specific:** Each application program was tightly coupled with the structure and format of its specific files.

## Problems Caused by Isolation

Data isolation creates barriers to effectively using the organization's data:

* **Difficulty in Integration:** Combining data from different, isolated files for reporting, analysis, or new applications was a complex and often manual process. It required custom programming or data conversion efforts for each integration need.
* **Limited Data Access:** Users or applications needing data from multiple sources found it hard or impossible to access the required information without specialized tools or custom programming.
* **Hindered Development:** Building new applications that required data from various existing files was challenging and time-consuming due to the need to understand and interface with disparate data formats and structures.

## How DBMS Overcomes Isolation

[[DBMS|Database Management Systems]] overcome data isolation by providing a unified and standardized approach to data management:

* **Central Repository:** A [[Database Concepts#What is a Database?|database]] acts as a central, integrated repository for the organization's data.
* **Standard Data Model:** Data is organized according to a specific [[Data Models|data model]] (like the [[Relational Model]]), providing a consistent and logical structure across all data.
* **Standard Access Language:** A standard query language (like [[SQL]]) allows users and applications to access any data in the database, regardless of its physical storage details or the application that originally created it.
* **[[View of Data (Data Abstraction)|Data Abstraction]]:** The DBMS hides the physical storage details and provides a consistent logical view, making data access easier for application developers and end users.

By centralizing data and providing standardized access methods and models, a [[DBMS]] breaks down data silos and makes the organization's data a shared, integrated resource, overcoming the limitations imposed by data isolation in file systems.
